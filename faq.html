              <p>
                ShareTC is a secure file sharing platform that allows you to directly share end-to-end encrypted files with another peer.

                How it works?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The platform encrypt your file directly in the browser. This way nobody can access your decrypted file. You can provide a key or use the generated one. Next you'll be able to share it using the RTC protocol avoiding connection to centralized service. This way nobody else than the desired peer can access your file and limit decryption risks.

                Why you should use it?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You should use our service for very sensitive information sharing from peer to peer. The file is crypted and never stored anywhere.

                Is it secure?
              </h3>
              <p>
                There is no such thing but by crypting on client side and by sharing directly with peer, data breach risk is very limited.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Depending on your government, using this service could be forbidden, that's why we recommend our users to use the TOR browser.
